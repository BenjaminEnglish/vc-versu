(About Meeting Preparation Decision)

this is an actual choice - see 7.6 events leading ot other actions

maybe see activities? (Going on to T.) 7.1

Some events make a situation so urgent that it has to be dealt with immediately, and for those times, we can use Choices.

	*** Event - Letter arrives (background, during Breakfast only) ***

	Narration: A postman interrupts with an envelope for Storm to sign for.

	Choice (Letter accepted): Storm takes the letter from the postman. But it's a
	subpoena for a mammoth lawsuit!
	-- Sign for it

	Choice: Storm refuses to accept the letter, and the postman takes it away,
	a little piqued.
	-- Refuse to take it

If a choice has another event named in brackets after "Choice", then that event happens immediately the choice is made. It can't happen at any other time, so no conditions should be supplied:

	*** Event - Letter accepted ***

	(The letter is carried by Storm.)

provide blurb ... you're about to address the council, this is usually normal for you but you have a sneaking suspicion that someone in teh audience knows about your ways. you'll have to be careful in what you say. however, you're coming down from a coke high. you could maintain appearances by taking some more, or you could not do illegal drugs and risk looking sweaty and anxious. ???

Character speech --> get drunk/high
-- Snort a line to take the edge off.

Character speech --> NOT get drunk/high
-- Go in cold, hope for the best.
