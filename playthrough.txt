(About Meeting Preparation Decision)

provide blurb ... you're about to address the council, this is usually normal for you but you have a sneaking suspicion that someone in teh audience knows about your ways. you'll have to be careful in what you say. however, you're coming down from a coke high. you could maintain appearances by taking some more, or you could not do illegal drugs and risk looking sweaty and anxious. ???

Character speech
